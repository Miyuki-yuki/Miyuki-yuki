# Hi, I'm Miyuki.

I develop mobile applications, web applications and websites. I am passionate about learning new things, so trying to learn more and more every day. 
My learning started with Python and Java. However, I am comfortable with not only those two but SwiftUI, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
After a couple of years of studying, I started to teach programming to share my knowledge and consolidate my basics.
